# DRAFT: first joint-com with Leto.legal

## 1/3 - problem statement

### Privacy = Trust

- lack of users-control over their sensitive data
- any companies has to ensure customer-trust against their data control rights
- good UX
- trust = retention
- anticipate = following good practices = hard

and this is why...

### Legislation (RGPD, etc.)

- compliance often comes too late
- fear of punishment
- difficulty to rethink/rebuild

## 2/3 - two complementary approaches

### blindnet

- generic & dev oriented
  - Helping developers build trustworthy applications through privacy.
  - DevKit: accompany your team to build privacy-by-design applications with minimal effort and maximal security
    - additional components connecting with your stack
    - doesn't require to rethink/rebuild the whole application
  - generic: not bound to a specific legislation
    - good practices over compliance
  - blindnet.dev

### Leto.legal

- automated RGPD compliance
  - AI powered secured and automated data mapping
  - comes ON TOP of your pre-existing stack
  - **TO BE COMPLETED** by leto.legal

## 3/3 - collaboration

### complementary

- covers full spectrum
  - anticipate with blindnet
  - control with Leto.legal
  - both at any dev step

### Interoperability

- both defining open standards

  - [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/schemas/priv)
    - **TO BE DONE** by Milstan: short presentation of PRIV focusing on the difference/complementarity with UROPA
  - [UROPA](https://github.com/uropa-project/uropa)
    - **TO BE COMPLETED** by Leto.legal: short presentation of UROPA underlying/complementarity with PRIV

- In the open (call to action: contribute and follow)
  - blindnet
    - [open org](https://github.com/blindnet-io/openness-framework)
    - [open source](https://github.com/blindnet-io/)
