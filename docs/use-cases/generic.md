## Client Profile : The Company

The Company offers a software solution taking an important place in its users' lives. As such, it collects important (often confidential or sensitive) data.

## Context

The Company is subject to regulation regarding Privacy Requests. Different regulation (GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, HIPPA, Country-specific laws) oblige the Company to receive and respond to different requests that its users may make. E.g. a user may request to have access to data about them, have their data deleted, data processing restricted, or to revoke a certain consent they gave earlier.

## Current Situation

Within their Privacy Policy, the Company provides an e-mail address, "**privacy@company.com**" to which such requests can be sent. The requests are then processed manually (in-house or by an external DPO).

This is problematic on several levels:

- **E-mail is not secure.**
  Users might end-up disclosing confidential, health-related or sensitive information over e-mail which would be a direct violation of [Article 32 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/), heavily sanctioned by most countries in the EU.

- **Requests are tedious to process**.
  Expressed in the form of free text of an e-mail, Privacy Request must be read and processed by a human, which is cost-intense and slow.

- **If changes are to be made in the Company's databases, it must be done manually**.
  Linking the Requests and the responses to the actual data that the Company has is very cumbersome and requires a human DPO processing a Privacy Request to log in the Company's system and manually apply any changes made necessary by Privacy Request in question.

## Using blindnet DevKit

It takes three easy steps for the Company to include the most advanced Privacy Request processing features in its existing software, and offer a Privacy Center for users, in full sync with the data that the Company has:

### Step 1 - Configuration

The Company feeds blindnet DevKit with general information (a Privacy Policy, server locations, data retention policies) and provides a mapping between data categories in its database and [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) terms.

blindnet's PRIV (Privacy Request Interchange Vocabulary) is an easy-to-use taxonomy of tags - an entry point to the whole world of automation. It allows to connect an existing system with blindnet's knowledge base and rule engines in order to deliver the ultimate privacy experience.

### Step 2 - Report key events

Whenever an important thing happens - a new User is known by the system, gives particular consent, or closes an account - the Company lets blindnet DevKit know. A chain of events is constructed. With every new event the blindnet's Privacy Compiler (part of Privacy Computation Engine) updates a state of allowed processing.

When a User makes a Privacy Request, the Privacy Computation Engine is able to resolve it against that state and deliver response recommendations or automatically issue responses.

### Step 3 - Replace the e-mail with Privacy Request Builder

Finally, the Company can replace the "**privacy@company.com**" with a nice user-friendly interface (provided in blindnet DevKit) allowing Users to make Privacy Requests as a part of their user experience with the Company's systems.

Many requests can trigger an immediate reply, with no human intervention (e.g. Transparency requests).
In some cases Privacy Computation Engine can be configured to only deliver response recommendations, subject to human (DPO) validation (through an interface provided as a part of blindnet DevKit).

Only requests not falling into any of the PRIV categories still require human intervention.

## Result

Thanks to blindnet DevKit the Company has a smart way to reduce the time and cost of processing Privacy Requests.

Complying with privacy regulation mandates becomes an opportunity to build trust and offer superior user experience consistent with the brand's values.

## Need more?

blindnet DevKit does much more. It is a complete solution for [privacy-enabled connectedness](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md), allowing developers to quickly gain ground on all the three pillars of privacy: [Transparency, Confidentiality and Control](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/principles/RFC-SPEP.md).

- _Working with sensitive data?_ Offer end-to-end encryption using [blindnet's encryption services](https://github.com/blindnet-io/api-scala).
- _Sharing Data with partners?_ Propagate users' Privacy Requests using blindnet's [Privacy Request Multicast Protocol](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/b7d2bd0aab509a5d83ed42822b0ba19e27bef905/refs/schemas/protocols/RFC-PRMP.md)
